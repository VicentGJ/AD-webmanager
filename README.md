# Introduction
This project is a web interface for Active Directory made using Flask and
python-ldap, focusing in easy of use and simplicity.

It's using the connecting user's own credentials to connect to the
directory and allow a variety of operations.

The goal is to be able to do most common directory operations directly
through this web interface rather than have to rely on command tools or
Windows interfaces.

Its compatible with both Windows Active Directory and Samba4 domain controllers.

# History
This project is a fork of samba4-manager, created by St√©phane Graber
and the Edubuntu community.
This project was pick up for internal use at Havana's Technology University
in 2017, and since it has received numerous updates, additions, and changes.
We decided to release our version as a fork since the original project has 
not been updated in the last four years and is incompatible with the latest 
versions of Python and supporting libraries.
We will keep updating the project for our organization and the community, 
and we will love to receive all kinds of feedback and contributions.

# Install and run

## Local config

 * Access settings.py to configure
 * Put a random string in SECRET\_KEY

You can install and use the software from two sources: the distro's repository or from the internet:

## From distro's repository tested on Debian 10 & Ubuntu 20.04 using python2 (Not recommended, python 2 is deprecated)

```sh
$ sudo apt install python-ldap python-flask python-flaskext.wtf python-dnspython python-wtforms python-configparser python-tz
$ python ADwebmanager.py
```

## From the Internet as per Pipfile (Using Python 3.9, recommended way)

```sh
apt install git pipenv python3.9 python3.9-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev build-essential
pipenv install --python /usr/bin/python3.9
